<b><p align="center">WARNING: VERY OLD CODE</p></b>
<i><p align="center">This code was written in January of 2021. I have learned a lot since then and I am aware of the poor quality of the code.</p></i>

<hr>

<p align="center">Part of the code doing pairs extraction and calculating semantic similarity is not mine.
All classifiers achieved accuracy of 79%+/-0.5%. Performance of classifiers was limited by uni-dimensionality of the data.</p>
