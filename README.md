## :scroll: Project description
Analysis of performance of SVC, linear regression and neural network classifiers in recognizing premise-conclusion pairs of sentences based on semantic similarity. 
All classifiers achieved accuracy of 79%+/-0.5%. Performance of the classifiers was limited by uni-dimensionality of the data.


## :hammer: Technologies used
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Matplotlib


## :arrow_up: Room for improvement
This is an old project of mine and it would certainly benefit from cleaning the code and a general refactoring.
